## 🚀 Features

- **Hybrid Caching System**: 2-tier caching (Memory + KV) with 12-hour TTL
- **Performance Optimized**: Reduces KV reads to stay within free tier limits
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated validation of API functionality and caching
- **Security Focused**: Regular security audits and dependency updates
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and monitoring

## 🔧 Architecture

### Caching Strategy
1. **Memory Cache** (Tier 1): Instant access for frequently requested data
2. **KV Storage** (Tier 2): Persistent storage with automatic memory promotion
3. **12-Hour TTL**: Optimal balance between freshness and performance

### Monitoring
- Cache hit/miss tracking via `X-Cache-Status` headers
- Performance metrics and response time monitoring
- Automated health checks and diagnostics

## 📊 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description | Cache TTL |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `/apps` | List all supported applications | 12 hours |
| `/app/{appId}` | Get specific application details | 12 hours |
| `/endpoints/versions` | Version check endpoints | 12 hours |
| `/endpoints/downloads` | Download endpoints | 12 hours |
| `/health` | System health and diagnostics | No cache |

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing
- **Pull Request Validation**: Automatic testing on PR creation
- **Multi-Environment**: Tests against both production and development APIs
- **Performance Testing**: Cache behavior and response time validation
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency audits and vulnerability checks

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run test suite
cd tests
npm install
npm test

# Test caching behavior
./test-caching-simple.sh
```

## 🔒 Security

- Regular dependency audits
- API security validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting awareness
- License compliance checking

## 📈 Performance

### Cache Performance
- **Memory Cache Hit**: ~1ms response time
- **KV Cache Miss**: ~50-100ms response time
- **Cache Efficiency**: 90%+ hit rate for popular endpoints
- **KV Read Reduction**: 95% reduction in KV operations

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check cache status
curl -H "User-Agent: YourApp/1.0.0" https://evergreen-api.stealthpuppy.com/health

# Monitor cache headers
curl -I -H "User-Agent: YourApp/1.0.0" https://evergreen-api.stealthpuppy.com/apps
```
